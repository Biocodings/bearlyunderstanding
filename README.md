This project was started at the AI Genomics Hackathon on June 23-25, 2017, hosted by Silicon Valley Artificial Intelligence in San Francisco. 

The goal of our project is to identify new antigen candidates for immunotherapy of Onno's NF2 condition. To do this, we use a combination of existing genomics tools and our own neural network to identify the most promising antigen candidates.
